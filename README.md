Project Description:

This project will create a blog platform where users can manage blog
posts with CRUD functionality. The platform will integrate LLaMA 3, an
advanced NLP model, to assist in generating high-quality text and
summarizing long articles. The user interface will be simple yet
functional, ensuring ease of use.


Problem Statement:

inconsistent posting, decreased audience engagement, and a
decline in blog popularity and influence.

platform that assists users in creating, reading, updating, and
deleting blog posts, as well as generating and summarizing
content using advanced natural language processing (NLP)
models.

and MongoDB.
 Implement CRUD operations for managing blog posts.
 Integrate LLaMA 3 from HuggingFace for AI-based text
generation and summarization.
