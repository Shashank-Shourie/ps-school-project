Project Description:

This project will create a blog platform where users can manage blog
posts with CRUD functionality. The platform will integrate LLaMA 3, an
advanced NLP model, to assist in generating high-quality text and
summarizing long articles. The user interface will be simple yet
functional, ensuring ease of use.
